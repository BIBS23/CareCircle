# CareCircle
CareCircle is a pioneering mobile application designed to bridge the gap between the elderly in need and generous community members willing to lend support. In a world where the elderly often find themselves isolated or in need of basic necessities without a means to easily request help, CareCircle steps in as a beacon of hope and solidarity.
